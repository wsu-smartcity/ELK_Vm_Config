# WSU ESIC ELK+Beats Setup Spec

This repo contains specs/configs for the set-up of the ELK stack and beats, for general maintenance. Now that the bare-metal
setup is known, it would be nice to deploy it as a docker image, but its not really necessary and
having direct access to the server is much easier.
